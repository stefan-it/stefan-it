### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm working at [Bavarian State Library](https://github.com/dbmdz) ðŸ“š now and please
visit, watch and star our [pre-trained language models repo](https://github.com/dbmdz/berts)!

I'm currently working on the awesome [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair)
library and love contributing to [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

### ðŸ“° Latest news

Latest news of new language models, PRs and many more!
